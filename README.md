### A very simple react portfolio
  This is my simple personal portfolio built with react.
  The front end styling was made possible with bootstrap and the icons are from fontawesome.
  Please leave a star if you like and you are free to clone the repo.
  Remember you must have nodejs and npm installed on your machine, then type npm install
  after cloning the repo. Cheers!
